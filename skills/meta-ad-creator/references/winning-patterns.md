# Winning Ad Creative Patterns

Based on analysis of $70K+ Meta Ads spend for Petbucket (120 days, 3.78x ROAS).

## Format Performance

| Format | ROAS | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Carousel + Slideshow | Best | Dynamic, multiple products |
| Dynamic Catalog | 9.6x | Automated, personalized |
| Static Image | 6.5x | When done well |
| Single Image | Baseline | Simple but limited |

**Takeaway:** Carousel > Static, but great statics still beat mediocre carousels.

## Creative Structure That Converts

### The Warning Hook Formula
```
⚠️ Warning/Problem → Solution → Benefits → CTA
```
Example: "Don't Wait Until It's Too Late → NexGard Protection → Vet Recommended, 75% Off → SHOP NOW"

### The Social Proof Formula
```
Result/Stat → Product → Trust Signals → CTA
```
Example: "Join 50,000+ Pet Parents → PetBucket Products → Trusted Brands → SHOP NOW"

### The Value Stack Formula
```
Headline Hook → Product Display → Benefit List (✓) → Price/Offer → CTA
```
This is what worked best for Petbucket's static ads.

## Visual Elements That Work

### Backgrounds
- **Solid colors** outperform gradients and busy backgrounds
- **Contrasting colors** to product (blue bg for warm-colored products)
- **Brand-aligned** but not identical to logo color
- **Cohesive palette** — badge/widget colors MUST match the background theme (not default green on every variant)

*Color scheme analysis is performed by the meta-ad-optimizer skill during ad analysis. See its output for winning color data to feed into creative generation.*

### Subjects
- **Happy, healthy animals** (not sad/sick rescue angles)
- **Specific breeds** perform differently — test Golden Retriever, Corgi, French Bulldog first
- **Eye contact with camera** increases engagement

### Text on Image
- **Large bold headline** — readable at mobile size
- **Max 2 lines** for headline
- **Benefits as checkmark list** — scannable
- **Price/discount in contrasting color**

### Brand Elements
- **Logo:** Top-right, not too large (15-20% of width)
- **Product boxes:** Visible but not dominant
- **Trust badges:** Bottom corner (awards, ratings)
- **CTA button:** Bold, contrasting color (green on blue works)

## Demographic Insights (Petbucket)

| Age | ROAS | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| 65+ | 4.1x | Best performer by far |
| 55-64 | 3.8x | Strong |
| 45-54 | 3.5x | Good |
| 35-44 | 3.2x | Average |
| 25-34 | 2.8x | Below average |
| 18-24 | 1.9x | Weak |

**Takeaway:** Older demographics convert significantly better for pet products.

## Placement Performance

| Placement | ROAS |
|-----------|------|
| Facebook Search | 5.29x |
| Facebook Marketplace | 4.38x |
| Facebook Feed | 3.8x |
| Instagram Feed | 3.2x |
| Instagram Stories | 2.9x |

## Ad Fatigue Signals

- **Frequency > 3:** Start rotating creatives
- **Frequency > 4:** Urgent — ad fatigue active
- **CTR declining week over week:** Time to refresh
- **CPA rising > 20%:** Creative exhaustion

### Rotation Strategy
- Generate 20-30 variants per cycle
- Rotate every 2-3 weeks
- Keep top 3 performers running
- Replace bottom 50% with new variants
- **Same formula, different execution** (new subject + color + headline)

## CTA Performance

| CTA | Best For |
|-----|----------|
| SHOP_NOW | E-commerce (best overall) |
| LEARN_MORE | Consideration phase |
| GET_OFFER | Promotions |
| SIGN_UP | Lead gen |

**Always use SHOP_NOW for direct e-commerce.**

## ⚠️ Banned Words (Compliance)

NEVER use these words in ad banners, badges, or image text:
- **pharmacy** / **online pharmacy**
- **prescription** / **Rx**  
- **drug** / **medication** / **medicine** / **pharmaceutical**

These trigger Meta ad rejections and regulatory compliance issues. Use alternatives:
- Instead of "pharmacy" → "pet store", "pet protection store"
- Instead of "prescription" → "vet-recommended", "vet-approved"
- Instead of "medication/drug" → "treatment", "protection", "products"
