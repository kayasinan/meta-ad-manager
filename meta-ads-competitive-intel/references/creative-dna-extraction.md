# Creative DNA Extraction Guide

## Overview

Creative DNA is the underlying formula that makes a competitor's ad work. Your job is to deconstruct successful competitor ads into their component parts, understand what makes them tick, and provide that intelligence to the Creative Producer so they can build Mode B variants.

Creative DNA has 7 dimensions that together define what makes an ad effective:

1. **Format** — Static image, video, carousel, collection, dynamic
2. **Layout composition** — Where elements are positioned
3. **Color approach** — Dominant colors, palette, contrast
4. **Copy structure** — Hook, body, CTA pattern
5. **Visual style** — UGC, studio, lifestyle, illustration, animation
6. **Text overlay approach** — Density, placement, treatment
7. **Emotional angle** — Fear, aspiration, social proof, urgency, humor, trust

## 1. Format Dimension

**What it means:** The structural container for the ad.

### Format Categories

**Static Image**
- Single photograph
- Illustrated image
- Designed graphic
- Text overlay on background
- Example: Product photo on white background

**Video**

- Horizontal video (16:9, optimized for Feed)
- Square video (1:1)
- Length: 6s, 15s, 30s, 60s+
- Style: UGC, studio, animation, testimonial

**Carousel**

### Format Dominant in Market

Track which format is prevalent among high-performing (longevity 7+) competitor ads:

Example: "Skincare market: 60% video, 25% carousel, 15% static image."

**Action for Creative Producer:** "Video format is dominant in this market. Allocate 60% of new creative to video format."

### Composition Cues

Look for:
